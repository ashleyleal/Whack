# Whack
ECE241 Final Project

Created by Ashley Leal & Andrew Lee for ECE241 Final Project @ University of Toronto

# Project idea
This project implements a digital version of the classic arcade Whack-a-Mole game using an FPGA. The project uses physical buttons on the board to serve as inputs for the game. The player can use these inputs to control the game and “whack” the moles as they dynamically show up on the UI, implemented using a VGA as output.
